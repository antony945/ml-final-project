ML Projects

ML Projects can be carried out in team of max 2 people, consist in implementing a Reinforcement Learning Agent based on Q-learning, and must implement two approaches:

Tabular Q-learning

Deep Q-Network (DQN), in its simplest form (using a single NN to approximate the Q-function)

Other approaches can be also implemented, but the two above are mandatory.

Any environment can be used (even one developed in the project itself), but we recommend using some already available, such as those provided by [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) (formerly [OpenAI Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/), which is also OK). 

Projects must be approved by the teacher before being submitted and presented. 

Projects can be submitted at any time through [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjCtm-loqE1PKyxkoTKrW8mG2FBAnWauKnAi5XxIRQoaqu-Q/viewform) form and must be uploaded before the discussion starts. The submission must consist in a single zip file containing:

(mandatory) A pdf report describing: the problem addressed, the solution adopted, the experimental results, and the architecture of the implementation.

(mandatory) The source files, collected in a single dir named src.

Optionally, to facilitate the presentation, a Colab notebook can be linked. The content of the notebook must be the same as that of the sources, which must be submitted anyway.

Discussions will take place as per the calendar below. Every project will be discussed separately with all team members. Every member is required to have full kowledge and understanding of every aspect of the project.
